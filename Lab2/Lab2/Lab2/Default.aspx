    <h4>Welcome to Inland Marina located on the south shore Inland Lake, just a small
    commute from major centers in the south west.</h4>

    <p>Inland Marina was established in the 1967 shortly after Inland Lake was created
    as a result of the South West damn. From its humble beginnings, it has grown to be

    Inland Lake has become a popular tourist destination in the south west. Boat owners 
    from California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah are attracted to the area. </p>
    
    <p>Inland Marina has 90 slips ranging in size from 16 to 32 feet in length. Dock services include 
    electrical and fresh water. Please feel free to browse our available slips, or if you are ready to
